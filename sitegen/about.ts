      p("So, what is ", VanJS(), "? Well, it's a reactive UI framework. It's ", b("more than 100 times"), " smaller than React. It doesn't require installation, configuration, dependencies or transpiling to use. But I think, in a nutshell, the best way to describe it is: ", i(VanJS(), " is the scripting language for UI, just like ", Symbol("bash"), " is the scripting language for terminal.")),
      p("Ever since the birth of GUI, there is no shortage of UI frameworks: MFC, Win Form, WPF, Qt, Flutter, SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose, React, React Native, to name a few. They enabled us to build highly sophisticated UI apps. But on the other hand, frameworks and tools themselves could be the entry barrier for UI programming: high-specialized IDEs, lengthy tutorials, mysterious problems that might arise here and there, being forced to program in a designated style, and most importantly, ONLY people with specialized skills can work on it. Even JavaScript, with \"", i("Script"), "\" in its name, is trying to become a compiled language: JSX, TSX, transpiling, and plugins/extensions to allow us to work with the transpiled code."),
      p("On the flip side, the default way for programmers to interact with computers remains the same for over 50 years - shells, CLI programs, and sometimes, ASCII arts. Why? Is terminal inherently better than GUI? Or does it just make programmers look cooler? I think the foundamental reason that lies behind, is the power of scripting, the power to start coding immediately in any environment, the power to build useful things with just a few lines of code, the power to easily assemble various code snippets together."),
      p(i("Being the scripting language for UI"), ", is the foundamental principle that guides the design of ", VanJS(), ". It's based on JavaScript so that it can work in as many environments as possibles, not only for websites, but also for webviews which most major OSes support. It has declarative composing API and reactive state binding as it enables an easier way to describe comprehensive UI logic within just a few lines of code. It has strictly 0 dependencies so that it can be used right after the code is typed. It's JSX-free thus REPL can be easily done in the browser console."),
      p("So, why is ", VanJS(), " good to the world? I think the world needs a scripting way to build UI, and there are way more scenarios where UI can be more beneficial than people might have realized, for personal utilities, for teamwide tools, and for user-facing products as well. We are quite used to the categorization between front-end engineers and back-end engineers, and we are quite used to the notion that back-end engineers will never do UI. We think only a very small number of people need to know how to build UI."),
      p("But, is it really the case? I've been a back-end engineer for more than a decade. I had been leading a team which manages 100+ data processing pipelines and datasets produced by them.
